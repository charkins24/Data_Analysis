\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This document is a beta version of KIPP:Chicago's \textbf{Principal Packet}.  This proposed principal packet has two aims.  First, and most importantly, to present our school leaders with actionable data and analysis to help our students achieve at the highest level.  Secondly, is to provide a proof-of-concept that will move regional reporting \emph{away from} PowerPoint style decks and towards more thoughtful, insightful, and informative reports.  To this end, this report needs to include useful, clear data visualization that are explained and contextualized with incisive analytical prose, rather than the near meaningless, overly-simplified prolix of the dreaded bullet point.\sidenote{For more on the pitfalls of PowerPoints ``cognitive style'' please read Edward Tufte's excellent \emph{The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint} (\url{http://bit.ly/SuaNBh}).}

  Ethnicity (by school?)
  Gender
  FRL
  SPED
  ELL

We currently enroll **X** students of whom **Y** are female and **Z** are male.

Perhaps more pertinent the questoin denoting this section is to ask at what level are our studetns entering our schools and how does that compare to nationally?
  
  
\section{Are our students staying with us?}
This section should have a simply graph showing the proportions for kids leaving.  We should probably also look at numbers leaving and reasons by grade (Are we losing kids at a predictable point?).  A table should be included in a side bar showing reasons, counts, and percentages.


Historical mobility and attrition data

Enrollment and attendence

\section{Are our students progressing and achieving academically?}

ISAT last year
MAP Results from last year
MAP Results this year

Look at percentile/quartile movement fall to fall?  

Results by sped?

\section{Are we supporting kids to and through collegte?}

Graph of Selective versus no selective.

\section{Do we attract and retain talented educators?}

Teacher attrition rates
Graph/table of exit reasons

Q12 and HSR results 

\section{Are we building a financially sustainable model?}

Probably budget burn data here

\newthought{This section is a test of graphing,} espeically of the marginal variety.

\caption{KIPP Chicago Weekly Attendence Rates}
\end{margintable}



The KIPP Chicago \textbf{year-to-date attendence rate} is **96\%***. The YTD attendance rates for each of the three schools is 96\%, 96\%, and 96\% for KAPS, KAMS, and KCCP, respectively.\sidenote{The school year for for began on August 13, 2012 for KAPS and KAMS and on August 27, 2012 for KCCP.  Consequntly all of the attendance analysis is bassed on data pulled from PowerSchool for the time between August 13 and today (November 6, 2012).}   Table \ref{t:Att_by_week} shows weekly attendence rates for year school as well as YTD attendence rates. 

Daily Enrollement, our consequent daily attendence goal (96\% of Enrollemt), and daily attendence are displayed for each day by week in Figure \ref{f:Enroll_Attend_Daily}.  Clearly the three schools have seen incresing enrollment over the first eight weeks of the school year (through the week of September 24 for KAPS and KAMS and the week of October 15 for KCCP).
